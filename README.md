Loan Approval Prediction - Various Machine Learning Models

Background
The company seeks to automate (in real time) the loan qualifying procedure based on information given by customers while filling out an online application form. It is expected that the development of ML models that can help the company predict loan approval in accelerating decision-making process for determining whether an applicant is eligible for a loan or not.

**The machine learning models used in this project are:**

1. Logistic Regression
2. K-Nearest Neighbour (KNN)
3. Support Vector Machine (SVM)
4. Naive Bayes
5. Decision Tree
6. Random Forest
7. Gradient Boost

**Data Source:** https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ninzaami/loan-predication

Result
1. In general, it can be seen that all models can achieve up to 70% accuracy.
2. The highest accuracy is 93%.
